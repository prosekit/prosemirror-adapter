# Preact Support Plan

- [x] Step 1: Scaffold `@prosemirror-adapter/preact`
  - Copy React adapter structure as baseline (package.json, tsconfig, src layout).
  - Replace React-specific imports with Preact equivalents (`preact`, `preact/hooks`, `preact/compat`).
  - Ensure renderer/utilities expose the same public API surface as the React adapter.
  - Completed initial Preact-specific rewrites for provider, renderer, and view factories.
- [x] Step 2: Integrate package into monorepo tooling
  - Add new TypeScript project references and update build configuration if needed.
  - Update linting and formatting configs if they require explicit package inclusion.
  - Wire workspace dependencies so `pnpm` can build/test the new package.
  - Added preact patterns to ESLint config and confirmed workspace tooling recognizes the package.
- [x] Step 3: Author tests and quality gates
  - Skipped standalone unit tests to stay aligned with the React package surface.
  - Added dedicated Preact example and e2e fixtures to exercise adapter flows.
  - Captured testing approach and parity expectations during implementation.
- [x] Step 4: Documentation & DX polish
  - Updated root README table/badges and added Preact example README/content.
  - Authored `packages/preact` README with usage snippets mirroring React docs.
  - Added changelog entry, ensured package metadata aligns with repo standards.
- [ ] Step 5: Validation & release prep
  - Ran `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run fix`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm run typecheck` after latest updates.
  - Draft changelog or changeset entries describing Preact addition.
  - Prepare PR summary once CI passes, noting any follow-ups.
