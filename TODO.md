# TODO - Add Preact Support

Created at: 2025-09-26T08:14:28Z (UTC)

- [x] Step 1: Scaffold `@prosemirror-adapter/preact` package (renderer, contexts, provider, TypeScript config, package metadata) — completed at 2025-09-26T08:33:23Z (UTC)
- [x] Step 2: Mirror React parity for docs and example (package README, root docs, new `examples/preact` with Vite setup) — completed at 2025-09-26T08:57:12Z (UTC)
- [ ] Step 3: Expand automated coverage to include Preact (e2e Playwright route, Vite config, dependencies, ensure `pnpm run test` exercises Preact)
- [ ] Step 4: Final polish and release prep (cross-check configs, tidy docs, remove `TODO.md` once all above are complete)
